# 425. Word Squares
# 
# Description:
# Given a set of words (without duplicates), find all word squares you can build from them.
# 
# A sequence of words forms a valid word square if the kth row and column read the exact 
# same string, where 0 â‰¤ k < max(numRows, numColumns).
# 
# For example, the word sequence ["ball","area","lead","lady"] forms a word square because 
# each word reads the same both horizontally and vertically.
# 
# b a l l
# a r e a
# l e a d
# l a d y
# 
# Note:
# There are at least 1 and at most 1000 words.
# All words will have the exact same length.
# Word length is at least 1 and at most 5.
# Each word contains only lowercase English alphabet a-z.
# 
# Example 1:
# Input:
# ["area","lead","wall","lady","ball"]
# 
# Output:
# [
#   [ "wall",
#     "area",
#     "lead",
#     "lady"
#   ],
#   [ "ball",
#     "area",
#     "lead",
#     "lady"
#   ]
# ]
# 
# Explanation:
# The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).
# 
# Example 2:
# Input:
# ["abat","baba","atan","atal"]
# 
# Output:
# [
#   [ "baba",
#     "abat",
#     "baba",
#     "atan"
#   ],
#   [ "baba",
#     "abat",
#     "baba",
#     "atal"
#   ]
# ]
# 
# Explanation:
# The output consists of two word squares. The order of output does not matter (just the order of words in each word square matters).

# Summary:
# Backtrack + TRIE
# Idea from https://leetcode.com/problems/word-squares/discuss/91333/Explained.-My-Java-solution-using-Trie-126ms-1616
# and https://leetcode.com/problems/word-squares/solution/
# 
# Build a TRIE at first, then do backtrack to check all possibilities.
# 
# O(N * 26^L * L) time, N is number of words and L is length of a single word
