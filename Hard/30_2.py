# 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words
# 
# Description:
# You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.
# 
# Example 1:
# Input:
#   s = "barfoothefoobarman",
#   words = ["foo","bar"]
# Output: [0,9]
# Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar" respectively.
# The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
# 
# Example 2:
# Input:
#   s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
#   words = ["word","good","best","word"]
# Output: []
