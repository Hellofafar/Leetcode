# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops
# 
# Description:
# There are n cities connected by m flights. Each fight starts from city u and arrives at 
# v with a price w.
# 
# Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city src and the destination 
# dst, your task is to find the cheapest price from src to dst with up to k stops. If there 
# is no such route, output -1.
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: 
# n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
# src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
# Output: 200
# 
# Example 2:
# Input: 
# n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
# src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
# Output: 500
# 
# Note:
# The number of nodes n will be in range [1, 100], with nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1.
# The size of flights will be in range [0, n * (n - 1) / 2].
# The format of each flight will be (src, dst, price).
# The price of each flight will be in the range [1, 10000].
# k is in the range of [0, n - 1].
# There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.
