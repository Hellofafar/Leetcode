# 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II
# 
# Description:
# We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
# 
# I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
# Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
# However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.
# 
# Example:
# 
# n = 10, I pick 8.
# 
# First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
# Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
# Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.
# 
# Game over. 8 is the number I picked.
# 
# You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
# Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.

# Summary:
# Get idea from: https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower-ii/discuss/84764/Simple-DP-solution-with-explanation~~
# For each number x in range[i~j]
# we do: result_when_pick_x = x + max{DP([i~x-1]), DP([x+1, j])}
# --> // the max means whenever you choose a number, the feedback is always bad and therefore leads you to a worse branch.
# then we get DP([i~j]) = min{xi, ... ,xj}
# --> // this min makes sure that you are minimizing your cost.
