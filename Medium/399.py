# 399. Evaluate Division
# 
# Description:
# Equations are given in the format A / B = k, where A and B are variables represented as strings, and k is 
# a real number (floating point number). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not 
# exist, return -1.0.
# 
# Example:
# Given a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0. 
# queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ? . 
# return [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ].
# 
# The input is: vector<pair<string, string>> equations, vector<double>& values, vector<pair<string, string>> 
# queries , where equations.size() == values.size(), and the values are positive. This represents the 
# equations. Return vector<double>.
# 
# According to the example above:
# 
# equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ],
# values = [2.0, 3.0],
# queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]. 
# The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero 
# and there is no contradiction.

# Follow the idea from discuss section.
# Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm
# Notice in the return line, if graph is not defaultdict, it will not work because a may be not the key in graph.
