# 731. My Calendar II
# 
# Description:
# Implement a MyCalendarTwo class to store your events. A new event can be added if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.
# Your class will have one method, book(int start, int end). Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.
# A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to all 3 events.)
# For each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a triple booking. Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
# 
# Your class will be called like this: MyCalendar cal = new MyCalendar(); MyCalendar.book(start, end)
# Example 1:
# MyCalendar();
# MyCalendar.book(10, 20); // returns true
# MyCalendar.book(50, 60); // returns true
# MyCalendar.book(10, 40); // returns true
# MyCalendar.book(5, 15); // returns false
# MyCalendar.book(5, 10); // returns true
# MyCalendar.book(25, 55); // returns true
# Explanation: 
# The first two events can be booked.  The third event can be double booked.
# The fourth event (5, 15) can't be booked, because it would result in a triple booking.
# The fifth event (5, 10) can be booked, as it does not use time 10 which is already double booked.
# The sixth event (25, 55) can be booked, as the time in [25, 40) will be double booked with the third event;
# the time [40, 50) will be single booked, and the time [50, 55) will be double booked with the second event.
# 
# Note:
# The number of calls to MyCalendar.book per test case will be at most 1000.
# In calls to MyCalendar.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the range [0, 10^9].

                self.booked.append((max(i, start), min(j, end)))
        
        self.calendar.append((start, end))
        return True


# Your MyCalendarTwo object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyCalendarTwo()
# param_1 = obj.book(start,end)

# Used for testing
if __name__ == "__main__":
    test = Solution()

# ------------------------------
# Summary:
# Brute force solution from Solution section
# Key idea is to maintain two lists: calendar and booked, which record single booking events and double booking events.
