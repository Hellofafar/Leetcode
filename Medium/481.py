# 481. Magical String
# 
# Description:
# A magical string S consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:
# 
# The string S is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of 
# characters '1' and '2' generates the string S itself.
# 
# The first few elements of string S is the following: S = "1221121221221121122â€¦â€¦"
# If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in S, it will be:
# 1 22 11 2 1 22 1 22 11 2 11 22 ......
# and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:
# 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 2 ......
# 
# You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the S itself.
# 
# Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the 
# magical string S.
# 
# Note: N will not exceed 100,000.
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: 6
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 
# 1's, so return 3.
